# Description

In this assignment, our task was to create a command-line CMS to manage a company's employee database. This application uses the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) for receiving employee/role/department information and the [MySQL 2 package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) for database storage.

When the user runs the application, they are prompted to view all employees, add an employee, update an employee role, view all roles, add a role, view all departments and add a department. When the user enters the respective information, the changes are then made in the database.

JavaScript | Node.js | MySQL
